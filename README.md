# 🚀 CI/CD Deployment Pipeline using GitHub Actions & Docker

This project demonstrates a **complete CI/CD pipeline** that automatically builds, tests, and deploys an application using **GitHub Actions** and **Docker**.

The main goal of this project is to show how modern DevOps pipelines work in real life:
- Code is pushed to GitHub
- Pipeline runs automatically
- Docker image is built
- Application is deployed automatically

---

## 🧠 What This Project Shows

- ✅ How to use **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
- ✅ How to **build and run Docker containers**
- ✅ How to **automate deployment**
- ✅ How a real DevOps pipeline works from code → build → deploy

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **GitHub Actions** – for CI/CD pipeline
- **Docker** – for containerization
- **Linux** – execution environment
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and automation

---

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline Flow

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions workflow is triggered
3. Pipeline:
   - Checks out the code
   - Builds Docker image
   - Runs the container
   - (Optionally) deploys the application
4. Deployment is completed automatically without manual work
